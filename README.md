# Semester Project 1 | Futurum

<img src="images/futurum_logo_2.webp" alt="Fuurum Logo">

First Exam at Noroff. We were to use our new knowledge of coding and UX design to create a homepage for a new "fictive" museum opening in our city. Our target were families and children who would like a place to learn after school.

## Description

This was our brief: 
An interactive science museum called the Community Science Museum is opening in your town/city. Its core target audience is primary and middle school children (ages 7-15) and families with young children. The museum wants an informative, appealing website to attract middle school pupils and their parents. The site should appeal to youngsters without pandering; it should take for granted that the audience is curious and intelligent. The website should be informative and engaging, encouraging viewers to visit the museum. The website should be responsive and easy to use on various devices.

Based on the first-semester curriculum, the semester project should reflect the student’s creative and technical knowledge and skills. This includes design principles, project management, communication technology, and development with HTML/CSS.

Target Audience & Design: The target audience should be carefully considered, and the proposed design should reflect this. A website prototype should be made using your chosen software (Adobe XD, Figma etc.)

Hi Mikael
Very nicely done on this delivery. A lot of the major focus points were really well handled and the site is respnosive, it uses semantic HTML and the CSS is DRY.

Here are some further comments:
- The Explore page could benefit from using a max-width property, reducing the font-size and using float on the image so that text could take up empty space.
- Meta name=”title” should just be the title element.
- @font-face is used to load the Andika font, but it’s called “open sans” so when Andika is applied to text it doesn’t work until “open sans” is applied which is actually loading Andika.
